Words of welcome:

Thank you all for coming all this way to celebrate our wedding. I'm so very 
fortunate to be here in front of you all, to be able to call myself the husband 
of Zelia and to call her my wife. After six years of being together, it's so 
wonderful to finally be able to say that.

Before we commence our dinner, we would like to thank our parents for raising us 
and taking care of us. Even though we are now leaving you and cleaving to each 
other, we will still rely on you for your wisdom and your experience for the 
years to come.

We would also like to thank Diane and Isaac, who have volunteered their gifts on 
our special day, with Diane doing Zelia and her mother's makeup, and Isaac 
acting as the ceremony pianist.

Additional thanks to Izzy, Diane, Eddy, and Tian, for being our bridesmaids and 
groomsmen. They have undertaken many tasks for us and have made our lives easier 
in immeasurable ways.

Finally, we want to thank those of you who have travelled here from different 
cities, provinces, and even countries. The sacrifices you have made in your time 
and resources to join us in our celebration mean so much to us and make us very
happy. 

Please witness as Zelia and I make the first cut on our wedding cake!

(cut cake, feed)

Before we dine, I would like to lead us in saying grace -- please feel free to 
join me in prayer.

Our Father in Heaven, 

- Thank You for bringing ALL our friends and family TOGETHER SAFELY to celebrate 
  with us today
- I would also like to thank you for placing Pastor Mason in our lives to lead 
  us closer to You
- We ask for Your FORGIVENESS for our sins that we have committed and will commit
- We trust in the power of Your Grace for You are a merciful God who is slow to 
  anger and abounding in steadfast love
- Let Your Holy Spirit guide us so that we can grow closer to You day by day and 
  bear WITNESS for You in the home and in the world
- Bless our time together so that this food will nourish our bodies and so that 
  our CONVERSATIONS will nourish our minds and souls
- (intentionally) Let this be the first of many joyful meals we share TOGETHER

In JESUS' name we pray, AMEN.
