Perhaps the number one purpose of a cover letter is an exchange between two 
parties - the employer seeks something that can characterize a great candidate, 
and the applicant wishes to convince the employer that he/she is the great 
candidate that they've been seeking. And since the resume already exists as a 
succinct summary of qualifications, it should be the cover letter's job to 
expand and fill in any gaps to be found in the resume. To that end, I find it 
useful to skip all the stiff formalism that conventionally surrounds cover letters, 
and jump straight into the desired exchange of information.

With regard to my ability to perform well in this position:
\smallskip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I have a \textbf{strong interest and enthusiasm in mathematics and 
            problem solving}. With high grades in my advanced level math 
        courses, multiple accolades in a variety of competitions, and a genuine 
        hobbyist affinity towards puzzles, I believe that my mindset will be 
        perfectly suited for tackling the problems that a QA Engineering 
        co-op at ruby will face. 
        \smallskip
    \item I possess \textbf{excellent communication and leadership skills}. I've 
        spent a lot of time performing well in various teaching and tutoring 
        roles (i.e. tutoring and counseling work experience not listed on my 
        resume), as well as leading and teaching my high school's computer 
        science team to strong provincial finishes in competitions.
        \smallskip
    \item I have acquired a \textbf{modest amount of experience}. In particular, 
        I believe that my time with full stack web development at inBay 
        Technologies, in conjunction with my prior work in network debugging and 
        security testing at CENX will make me an immediate strong starter in 
        a QA position at ruby. 
\end{enumerate}

I understand that there will be a large number of applications for this 
position. However, it is my belief that these outlined characteristics will 
enable me to best integrate with the culture at ruby, and to 
immediately become an asset upon starting. I hope that this letter served its 
purpose as a knowledge transaction, and that your consideration of my candidacy 
has been appropriately adjusted for it.
\smallskip

Thanks in advance for your time,

\textbf{Simon Zeng}
